## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, customer reviews for Kindle products are analyzed to identify trends, improve customer experience, and provide actionable business insights.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: Publicly available Kindle review dataset (e.g., Amazon or Kaggle).
- **Content**: Includes customer reviews, ratings, and optional metadata (e.g., product category, review date).
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and transformation using NLP techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kindle-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd kindle-sentiment-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize key trends and patterns.
3. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Lemmatization
4. **Modeling**:
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning-based approaches (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Results and Insights**:
   - Identify sentiment distribution.
   - Highlight common positive/negative themes in reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NLP: NLTK, spaCy
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy
